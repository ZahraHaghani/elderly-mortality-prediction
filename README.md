# elderly-mortality-prediction
We used different algorithms of machine learning to interpret the data of geriatric burn patients. The goal was to develop the best model predicting mortality based on epidemiological features.
Population changes while geriatric medicine continue to progress. We expect to have bigger number of the elderly in the near future. On the other hand, burn injuries as unpredictable devestating traumas, happen all the time. Here during a 10 year survey, we used epidemiologiical characteristics of our patients, to develop different models predicting mortality rate of each patient.
If interested, help us better train our models! Import your data on epidemiology of burn injuries and let the algorithms guess the probability of death of each patient.
